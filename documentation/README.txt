Installing the JessyInk extensions
==================================

The JessyInk extensions depend on the "inkex" script provided by Inkscape. Therefore, the easiest way to install them is to simply copy all the files found in the folder named "inkscapeExtensions" of the distribution to the directory containing the "inkex.py" file. Depending on your operating system, this file is usually located in one of the following directories:

on Windows (English localisation): "C:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\extensions"
on Linux: "/usr/share/inkscape/entensions"
on OS X: "/Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/extensions"

Having copied the files to the correct location, Inkscape will automatically display the submenu "JessyInk" in the "effects" menu. The submenu will contain entries for all the different JessyInk extensions.

Should you want to install the JessyInk extensions in a different location or should you experience problems running the extensions, please verify that one of the paths given at beginning of the Python script of each JessyInk extension points to the directory where the "inkex.py" script is located.
